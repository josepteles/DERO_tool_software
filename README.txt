This is the DERO tool.

DERO means: Designing Rotorcraft.

It is a concenptua / preliminary design application used to design helicopters and diverse rotorcraft.

The available models are: 

- Conventional, Coaxial, Tandem and NOTAR helicopter configurations and Compound configurations are also available;
- Cyclocopters;
- UAV / Drones;

There are basic (No BEMT calculations, just momentum theory) and detailed applications.

There's a main menu to select which tool you want to use and standalone applications aswell.

Feel free to go through the source code and alter at your own risk.



The code is neatly organized. But there are always better ways to do it. ;)



There can be some bugs. The source code is at an extensive level by now, but you can use MATLAB to debug it.
